1. Objectives (5 min). Resolve any issues preventing the team to continue.


* Need to create UML for the system.

2. Reports (15 min) from previous meeting

* Anton: has written some use cases for the RAD.
* Nothing else has been done.

3. Discussion items (35 min) 

* Use cases
   * Anton has written 4 use cases
   * By looking at the use cases, we discovered that NPCs and interactive objects are basically the same thing and should be the same in the domain model
* Sequence diagram
   * Done on the blackboard
* Finishing up the RAD
   * Once the user cases are finished, the RAD is mostly finished
* Issue tracking system
   * Trello will be used for issue tracking
* Technical things
   * com.games.monaden.model
      * Grid-based movement system will be based on a 2D array
      * Each tile (cell in the 2D array) will contain a value that represents what type of tile/object it is
      * The player character needs a current position (x,y) in the 2D array
      * Tiles that the player character can walk on are non-solid
      * Tiles that the player character cannot walk on are solid
         * Use XML file to input tiles to model
         * List of booleans for solidness
      * Game loops?
         * http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com
      * Entity-component
         * It will be easier to implement the game in an entity-component system, as it will avoid inheritance problems in the future

4. Outcomes and assignments (5 min) 

* Use cases
   * Stefan will finish up all high priority use cases
* Sequence diagram
   * Philip will make a digital version of the sequence diagram
* Character movement
   * Mikael will look into basic movement with keyboard listening, 2D arrays, and game loops
* Code
   * Anton will make a basic skeleton for the code
* Dialogue system
   * Philip will start thinking about how the dialogue system will work

5. Wrap up
* Meeting next thursday, 13-15.
